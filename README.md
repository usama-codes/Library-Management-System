This is my first OOP assignment of Library Management System in Java that I am uploading to Github.
The project was to make a Library Management System having the functionality of adding books, borrowing books, returning books, searching for books, displaying books and their information and adding users.
There are no such pre-requisites for the project to run on any IDE for Java. I made it using VS Code but it will run on all IDE's having support for Java.
